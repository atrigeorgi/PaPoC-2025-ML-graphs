### PaPoC 2025 - Machine Learning Graphs

This repository presents various performance metrics and visualizations related to **Unsupervised Learning** and **Supervised Learning** for anomaly detection.

#### Unsupervised Learning:
The "Performance Metrics for Unsupervised Learning on the SURFsara Data" section contains graphs that are directly related to **Table 3** in the PaPoC 2025 paper.

#### Supervised Learning:
The "Performance Metrics for Supervised Learning on the SURFsara Data" folder includes graphs corresponding to **Table 4** of the paper, while the "Performance Metrics for Supervised Learning on the UNSW-NB15 Data" folder contains graphs related to **Table 5**.

#### Data Imbalance and Classification:
Data imbalance in anomaly detection can significantly impact model performance, making it essential to apply effective strategies for balanced and reliable results.

In this work, the **anomalous class** is represented by the label `-1` (indicating outliers or unusual data points), and the **normal class** is denoted by the label `1` (representing typical or expected data points).

#### Visualizations:
This repository includes a series of graphs comparing the performance of different models and metrics for both unsupervised and supervised learning approaches, showcasing how each method handles imbalanced data and anomaly detection.
